# Adventure Works Data Analysis

This is the Maven Analytics course project I have practiced.

**Purpose** of this project is to develop end-to-end business solutions and I play as an analyst hired by Adventure Works Cycle.

**The dataset** is orginally from Microsoft and the data I worked in this project is refined by Maven Analytics. 

The whole project is built using **Power BI**. 

**Steps:**
1. Connect and Transform raw data
2. Build data model
3. Create new calculated columns and DAX calculations
4. Analyze, visualize data
5. Build an interactive Dashboard

**Requirements:**

Power BI Desktop 
- only available in Windows
- for Mac, a free solution I prefer to use is running Power BI on Amazon EC2 (can use free for 1 year after creating a new aws account, but don't forget to setup bill alarm because if it exceeds limits what it offers, you will get charged.)
